# Testing 

### Code validation 

### HTML

![HTML-validation](documentation/validate-html.png)

My HTML file showed no warnings or errors when validated


### CSS

![CSS-validation](documentation/validate-css.png)

The only warning on my own CSS files is for the background-clip attribute with the text property as it is deprecated but to my knowledge is is the only way to get the effect I was looking for. This is in my style.css file

![CSS-validation](documentation/validate-css-utilites.png)

My utilites.css file showed no warnings or errors

All other Warnings and errors are coming from Font Awesomes CSS files

### Javascript
