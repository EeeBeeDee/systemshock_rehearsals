# **SYSTEMSHOCK REHEARSALS**
Arts and crafts have been a part of our lives since the dawn of civilisation.
They have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, not least for their well documented mental health benefits.

There is a great satisfaction to be gained from embarking on and completing a project that reflects ones own personal style.

This project is a personal indulgence and reflects my love of both crafts and coding.  Both are a never ending journey which forms part of their appeal!

The project's overall aim is to deliver a small e-commerce site for a hypothetical yarn supply store called *Artisan Yarns*.  Whilst not a unique offering, it is my hope to further develop it after this course as more expertise is required to make it truely shine.

As for its justification, many crafters prefer the experience of going to a store and getting a feel for a product.  However, there is a niche for those know what they want and desire the convenience of an online order delivered straight to their home.
