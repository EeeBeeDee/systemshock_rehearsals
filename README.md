# **SYSTEMSHOCK REHEARSALS**

System shock Rehearsals is a passion project of mine as it is the exact business I would  love to open up myself. Not only a collection of equipment but people too that will make creating any sound of can think of as easily as possible.

The aim is to make the information easily available as possible through a single scrollable website which is accessible on all the most commonly used devices.
