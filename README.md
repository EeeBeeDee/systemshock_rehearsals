# **SYSTEMSHOCK REHEARSALS**

System shock Rehearsals is a passion project of mine as it is the exact business I would  love to open up myself. Not only a collection of equipment but people too that will make creating any sound of can think of as easily as possible.

The aim is to make the information easily available as possible through a single scrollable website which is accessible on all the most commonly used devices.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

For this project the three main prevalent colours I decided on were Persian Indigo #33006E, Raw Sienna #D98B5D and White #fff.

As the name came first I initally thought of yellow for its connection to lightning thought I found it too bright. With the Raw Sienna colour I found it pops off the screen enough without being distracting.

With the Persian Indigo the approach was similar, I needed a complementary darker colour that I felt had the same characteristics, eye catching without being too overbearing.

#### Typography

For typography I decided to go for a singular font from ![Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) called Manrope. With a similar approach to the colour palette I wanted to find font that at first glance was not standard but its appearance wasn't distracting or that it didn't affect readability.
